    <p>Master of Engineering in Software Development track at Duke University.
        Prior to this, I got a bachelor's degree in Computer Science from the Polytechnic University of
        Milan and a
        bachelor's degree in Electronics Engineering from Tongji University in 2020.
        After graduating with my undergraduate degree, I worked as a full-time software development engineer
        at Gaotu
        Techedu, an online education company listed on the American Stock Exchange.
        I am passionate about software development, willing to learn and do what it takes in order to
        achieve
        organizational goals.
